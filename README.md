## Introduction
Open Finance, Confidential Network Deploy financial infrastructures with privacy-preserving transparency. 
Pythagoras enables assets of any nature - dollar, bitcoin, equity, debt and derivatives. Its mission is to address the chllenges necessary to support this broad class of assets and diverse financial use cases, providing confidentiality while retaining the transparency of other blockchains. 
# What We Do ?
---
## Pythagoras solves the core problems inherent in blockchains today
### Confidentiality
Pythagoras uses zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation to support many privacy-preserving features
### Scalability
Pythagoras features a high-throughput ledger design, and reduces storage requirements through cryptographic accumulators
### Auditability
Specialized zero-knowledge proofs allow Pythagoras  to be publicly audited, while data remains confidential.
### Interconnectivity
Pythagoras breaks open data silos for easy interoperability between the main- and side-ledgers.
